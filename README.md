# Coursel #

Coursel is a simple grade calculator for (http://cmu.edu)[Carnegie Mellon University] students.
It takes advantage of (http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)[Backbone.js], (http://isotope.metafizzy.co)[Isotope], and (http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html)[HTML5 localStorage]. 
Much of the Backbone.js code based off of (http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html)[todos.js].
