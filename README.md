# Coursel #

Coursel is a simple grade calculator for (http://cmu.edu)[Carnegie Mellon University] students.
It takes advantage of [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone), [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co), and [HTML5 localStorage](http://diveintohtml5.org/storage.html). 
Much of the Backbone.js code based off of [todos.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/docs/todos.html).
